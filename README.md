# 🌙 Notte — Accessibility & Dark Mode

**From dark mode to full accessibility.**

A free, open-source browser extension that adapts any website in real time to be
easier to see and read — built as an accessibility tool **for the low-vision
community**, and useful to anyone who finds bright pages hard on the eyes.

Free forever: no ads, no donations, no tracking, no data collection. One codebase,
three browsers — **Chrome, Firefox and Safari** (iPhone, iPad and Mac).

> Notte is a **user-side** tool: it adapts pages for *you*, in your own browser. It
> is the opposite of a site-owner "accessibility overlay" — it never changes the
> site for anyone else, and never makes claims about a site's compliance.

## Install

Notte is free, on all three stores.

## What Notte does today

### Dark mode

A high-contrast dark-mode engine that darkens overly bright websites by
**remapping colors**, never by inverting them, so contrast stays high and the page
keeps its identity:

- 🌑 Light backgrounds become dark, light text becomes bright, and accent colors
  (buttons, badges, selected rows) stay distinct — contrast averages ~11:1 in testing
- 🎯 **Leaves already-dark sites alone** — it detects a site that already ships its
  own dark theme and stays out of the way
- 🖼️ Keeps **images, video, canvas and SVG in their natural colors**
- ⚡ Applies before the page paints, so there is no bright white flash
- 🔀 **Per-site on/off**, which always overrides the auto-detection

### The accessibility toolkit

Live since **24 August 2026**. The toolkit is not tied to dark mode: every tool
works on a **darkened page and on an ordinary bright page alike**, and each one is
remembered **per site**.

- **Guaranteed contrast** — a minimum contrast target. On a dark page it brightens
  text toward white; on a bright page it darkens text toward black.
- **Warm tint** — cuts blue light.
- **Brightness** — dims the whole page.
- **Saturation** — mutes color, all the way to greyscale.
- **Image dimming** — turns down glaring photos without touching the text.
- **Text size** — enlarges the page's type.
- **Letter and word spacing** — opens up crowded text.
- **Line spacing** — more air between lines.
- **Clearer font** — swaps in a dyslexia-friendly face (OpenDyslexic is bundled
  with the extension, so it works offline and on every site).
- **Link emphasis** — underlines every link so they stop hiding in the text.
- **Strong keyboard focus** — a thick, unmissable outline on the focused element.
- **Reduced motion** — stops animation and parallax.

### Still to come

Named plainly so you know what is *not* in the extension yet: **magnifier**,
**reading ruler**, **large cursor**, **read aloud**, and **profiles** (saved
presets you can apply in one click). These are being built as their own modules.

## How the engine works

Notte does **not** walk the page and restyle elements one by one. It works on the
page's **stylesheets**.

1. It reads every stylesheet the page has: `document.styleSheets`, sheets adopted
   by shadow DOM (`adoptedStyleSheets`), sheets that live inside each shadow root,
   and sheets that JavaScript builds at runtime — including CSS-in-JS rules that
   arrive with no change to the page's HTML at all.
2. **Cross-origin stylesheets** — the ones a browser refuses to let a page read
   under CORS — are re-fetched by the extension's background service worker, then
   parsed and transformed like any other.
3. Every color declaration is remapped through Notte's color model. It understands
   `hex`, `rgb`/`rgba`, `hsl`, `oklch()`, `color(srgb …)` and `color(display-p3 …)`,
   named colors, and the modern space-separated syntax with a `/ alpha` used by
   Tailwind and CSS Color 4. Hue and saturation are preserved; backgrounds, text,
   accents and borders each land in their own band so contrast is guaranteed rather
   than hoped for.
4. The result is emitted as **a single generated override stylesheet**, injected
   once. The browser's own cascade then applies it to every element — including
   elements that do not exist yet, and elements whose classes change later.

That last point is why the approach was chosen. Work is proportional to the number
of **CSS rules**, not to the number of elements multiplied by the number of times
they change, so Notte stays fast on long-lived web apps like Outlook Web and Gmail.
Notte re-runs its transform only when a **stylesheet** actually changes, not on
every DOM mutation.

Inline `style` attributes are the one exception — they beat any stylesheet, so a
narrow observer watches only for those and writes a targeted rule for each. Notte
never rewrites an element's own `style`, so there is nothing to fight.

The full design notes live in
[`docs/engine-v2-design.md`](docs/engine-v2-design.md).

## Permissions and privacy

Notte requests three things, and no more:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `storage` | To remember your per-site settings, in your browser, on your device. |
| `activeTab` | So the popup can act on the tab you are looking at. |
| `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]` | **Required by the engine.** When a page loads a stylesheet from another domain — a CDN, a font or component library — the browser blocks the page from reading that sheet under CORS. Notte's background service worker re-fetches the sheet so it can be darkened too. Without this, any site whose CSS is served from another domain would stay stubbornly bright. |

The broad host permission looks alarming, so here is exactly what it is used for:
the service worker is a **pure fetch relay for stylesheets**. It stores nothing, it
sends nothing anywhere, and there is no server, no account, no analytics and no
telemetry in this project. Your settings never leave your device. See
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md), and read
[`background.js`](chrome/background.js) — it is short, and it is the whole story.

## Repository layout

```
chrome/    Canonical source + ready-to-load build for Chrome / Edge / Brave
firefox/   Build for Firefox (adds the AMO extension id + Android compatibility)
safari/    Same source, wrapped with Xcode for Safari (iOS + macOS)
docs/      Engine design notes and store listings
tools/sync.sh   Copies shared files from chrome/ into firefox/ and safari/
```

The three folders share identical `content.js`, `shadow-patch.js`, `background.js`
and `popup.*`; only the `manifest.json` differs. **Edit the shared files in
`chrome/` only, then run `bash tools/sync.sh`** to realign `firefox/` and
`safari/`. There is no build step and no compiled output — the files you read are
the files that run.

## Building from source

### Chrome (and Edge, Brave)

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → select the `chrome/` folder.

### Firefox

1. Go to `about:debugging` → **This Firefox** → **Load Temporary Add-on** →
   pick any file inside `firefox/`.

### Safari (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision) — needs a Mac + Xcode

```bash
xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/safari \
  --app-name "Notte" --bundle-identifier com.yourname.notte \
  --project-location ~/Desktop
```

Open in Xcode, set your signing **Team**, **Run**, then enable it in
**Settings → Safari → Extensions**.
